# Gnome Restaurant Helper
An addon for the Alt1 Toolkit that tells you what you need to make food. (WIP)

## Tasks
* Detect when an order is being given, and parse information to determine what recipe and place is requested.
* Give list of most efficient methods 
  * to travel to the customer
  * to travel back to the Grand Tree
* Inventory-based (Maybe, maybe not, depending on how easy it is to process the inventory)
  * Calculate profits 
  * Show what ingredients you still need, as well as where to get them
